# Homeschooling Curriculum

## Schema

Declarative "understandings / concepts" with associated imperative "activities."

- Videos
- Products
- Examples
- Categorical Parent Item
- Dependencies
- Age
- Controversial / Objectionable
- Locale Specific

Every concept should have an activity, ideally.

Should these be organized into categories? I am finding a lot of these to be
cross-cutting...

<!-- Maybe categories could be defined as the benefits:

- Utility
- Knowledge Itself
- Spiritual -->
